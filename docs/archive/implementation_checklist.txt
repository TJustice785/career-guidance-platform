## Tips for Success

1. **Work Incrementally**: Build and test one feature at a time
2. **Use Git**: Commit frequently with clear messages
3. **Test Often**: Test after implementing each feature
4. **Read Error Messages**: They usually tell you what's wrong
5. **Use Console**: console.log() is your friend for debugging
6. **Ask for Help**: Don't hesitate to ask instructors or classmates
7. **Document**: Write notes as you build
8. **Stay Organized**: Follow the project structure strictly
9. **Time Management**: Start early, don't wait until the last day
10. **Backup**: Push to GitHub regularly
